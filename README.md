# Scott Forrest

I'm a PhD candidate in Mathematical Sciences at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in Brisbane, Australia, and I am researching animal movement methods and applications. In my research I have explored space use and home range approaches, some hidden Markov modelling, and step selection functions and their extensions, and I am also interested in the application of machine learning to ecological problems. I work at the interface between developing methodology and applications to scientific and conservation questions, and I am fascinated by the decision-making processes that lead to animal movement, from the level of neurobiology all the way to population dynamics.
